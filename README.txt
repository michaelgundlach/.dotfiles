Custom dotfiles - Vim configuration, etc - shared by me and Michael Gundlach.
Running `deploy` script copies them to your home directory. Will copy over
your existing ones without warning, so backup first. Will ask if you're Nathan
or Michael - this lets us share most of our config but have user-specific
sections.

So yeah, this is mainly for the two of us to share, but if anyone else wants
to use this, take and tweak as you like. :)
